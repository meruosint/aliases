Simple explanation on aliases


So you want to know what aliases are in linux.

Type this in google!!
"alias command in linux"

But on a serious note, let's create a simple alias in Linux.
say you want to create a command that directly connects to ovpn directly without going to the struggle of searching for the ovpn.
let's use an example of htb.ovpn say I have it in my downloads folder
## Usage
```console
alias htb ="sudo openvpn /home/machine/Downloads/htb.ovpn"
```

In your terminal:
```console
htb
```
This should work
You are welcome btw.
